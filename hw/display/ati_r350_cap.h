/*
 * ATI R300/R350 3D draw capture -- the on-disk record format.
 *
 * A capture is taken at the point where a draw is already a fully
 * resolved, device-state-free description: the R300DrawState the setup
 * produced and the R300Vtx array whose positions have been through the
 * vertex program and the viewport. Everything the rasterizer reads is
 * either in that pair or in the few registers the point-sprite path
 * consults, so a record replayed on a host reaches exactly the pixels
 * the device reached -- without redoing GART translation, VC_SWAP, the
 * AOS layout, the TX_FORMAT1 component select or GUI_HOST_SWAP_CNTL,
 * every one of which this model has had wrong at least once.
 *
 * Each record carries its own inputs AND the bytes the software
 * rasterizer left behind, so it is a self-contained test case: the
 * destination rectangle before the draw, the same rectangle after it,
 * the texture the draw sampled, and the aperture swapper's byte-lane
 * xor over each. `doc/radeon9800/gl-replay/` consumes it.
 *
 * Records are written in host byte order and host struct layout, and
 * the file header repeats every size the reader has to agree on: this
 * is a diagnostic between one build of this device and one build of the
 * harness beside it, not an interchange format.
 *
 * UNITS, because a size check cannot police them: a vertex's texture
 * coordinate is in the TEXELS of the unit `R300DrawState::tc_unit[k]`
 * names, which is what the vertex stage has always written and what
 * every capture on disk holds. The device's fragment interpreter takes
 * the guest's own units instead, and converts on the way into the
 * fragment frame rather than in the vertex -- deliberately, so that this
 * record keeps one meaning across the change that gave the sampler its
 * normalised coordinate. A reader needs no version check for it.

 * a pointer to it: from milestone M5 the shading a draw performs is the
 * guest's own program, so a record that did not carry it would not be a
 * self-contained test case at all.
 *
 * `rect_bytes` is (x1 - x0) * 4 * (y1 - y0): the rows are packed, not
 * at the destination pitch. A unit whose texture repeats one already
 * written sets its `bytes` to 0 and names the earlier record in `ref`;
 * a unit this draw does not sample has `bytes` 0 and `dedup` 0, which
 * is also what every record written before multitexturing existed says
 * about units one and up.
