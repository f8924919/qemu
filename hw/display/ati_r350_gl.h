/*
 * ATI R300/R350 -- the host-GPU rendering backend interface.
 *
 * This header is the whole contract between the device and whatever
 * draws its triangles on the host. It deliberately names no QEMU type:
 * a request is plain data, the backend keeps no device state, and the
 * three entry points below are the only ones the device calls. That is
 * what lets phase 2's milestone M3 move the backend onto its own thread
 * -- a request is already everything a worker needs -- and what lets a
 * Metal or SDL_GPU implementation replace ati_r350_gl.c without the
 * draw path noticing.
 *
 * Coordinates in a request are the device's own: y increases downward
 * and the origin is the render target's top-left corner. The backend
 * never touches a QEMU display backend or a window.
 *
 * The render target is RESIDENT (milestone M3). ati_r350_gl_target()
 * sizes it, ati_r350_gl_seed() copies emulated VRAM into it and
 * ati_r350_gl_fetch() copies it back out, and between those the caller
 * may draw into it as often as it likes without a byte crossing the
 * bus. M2 uploaded the destination rectangle twice and read it back for
 * every single draw; on this host that was 5.2 ms of the 6.5 ms a
 * full-screen draw cost (doc/radeon9800/glbench).
 *
 * What that buys has to be paid for in coherency, and the rules are
 * stated where they are enforced -- see "GL-OWNED RENDER TARGET" in
 * ati_r350_3d.c. The backend's own part of the contract is only this:
 * it holds one target, it holds it until told otherwise, and seed and
 * fetch are the only ways bytes move.
