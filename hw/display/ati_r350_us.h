/*
 * How many texture units this model binds, and how many interpolated
 * texture coordinate SETS the rasterizer carries. The two are
 * independent: a unit is bound texture state (TX_OFFSET_n and friends,
 * whose register blocks are sixteen deep on this part), a coordinate set
 * is interpolated per-vertex data that any number of units may sample
 * with.
 *
 * Both numbers are read off a live Mac OS X 10.5 desktop rather than
 * chosen. Its compositor fetches from units 0, 1 and 2, and its RS_IP
 * table is the full eight-entry identity -- TEX_PTR 0, 4, 8, 12, 16,
 * 20, 24, 28, so IP entry k is coordinate set k -- with RS_INST_COUNT
 * naming up to seven live instructions and fragment programs whose LD
 * instructions read the registers sets 3, 4, 5 and 6 land in. That is a
 * multi-tap filter, not a driver writing a table it does not use, and
 * eight is also the number the hardware has: RS_IP is eight entries
 * deep.
 *
 * The first attempt at this row set the count to TWO, from the two
 * TEX_PTR values a truncated refusal trace happened to print, and a
 * live boot then reported `rasterizer attribute routing 0x1` 49 times
 * with the menus still blank. Widening the trace to the whole table is
 * what produced the number above. Units cost draw state only; a
 * coordinate set costs per-vertex memory, and the rasterizer
 * interpolates only the sets a draw's own routing names, so a
 * single-texture draw pays for none of them.
